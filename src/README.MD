# 🐔 Premuim-Poultry Farm Website

Welcome to the digital home of our poultry farm — where tradition meets technology. This is a fully responsive, static website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases our farm’s story, fresh products, and contact details, along with a simple admin dashboard for internal use.

## 🌾 Our Story

Founded in the heart of Niger State, Nigeria, our farm began with a simple goal: to raise healthy birds and deliver fresh, organic eggs and poultry to families who care about quality. We believe that good food starts with good farming — and that means clean feed, humane care, and honest work.

This website is part of our commitment to transparency and accessibility. Whether you're a local customer, a curious visitor, or a potential partner, we invite you to explore what we do and why we do it.
